Peyman Golshani's Neurology Lab

- This Repository contains the code I've written for PingPing Zhao's Coding Team. 
- Reddot Labeling Uses OpenCV and Python for some contour/blob filtering for tracking a light source (pre-recorded)
- Mouse-Labeling uses OpenCV and DeepLabCut to annotate two mice movements 
- models/models.py entail resnet50,resnet101, and deeplabv2 pretrained models that can be used for different types of image segmentation
- V4_Analysis is a python notebook that lets a user remove white stripes using gaussian-denoising tools availible to them
